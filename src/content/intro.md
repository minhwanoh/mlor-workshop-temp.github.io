This workshop explores the emerging paradigm of using programmatic representations to enhance
the interpretability, generalizability, efficiency, and scalability of frameworks for agent
learning and decision-making. The goal of this workshop is to bring together the sequential
decision- making community, which includes robot learning, robotics, reinforcement learning,
imitation learning, planning, search, and optimal control, with the code generation and program
synthesis communities to confront the challenges in agent and robot learning at scale and solve
specific applications ranging from virtual agents to robotics.
